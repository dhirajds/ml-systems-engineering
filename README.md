To track my ml-systems-learning

# Languages utilized – C++ & Python

This repository contains my experiments for understanding ML system engineering, focused on:

- 🧠 C++ memory, threading, and graph execution
- 🐍 Python ML tooling and ONNX runtime
- 🔗 Pybind11 integration
- 🛠️ Embedded and GPU inference systems

## 📚 Contents
- `C++/` – Tensor, threading, and runtime experiments
- `Python/` – Autograd and ONNX utilities
- `pybind_integration/` – Python-C++ bindings
